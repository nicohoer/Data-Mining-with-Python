# Data-Mining-with-Python
In the winter semester 20/21 I took a course called "Data Mining". The content of this course was basic Data Mining and Machine Learning Models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Neural Nets and Clustering. In this course we covered the mathematical foundations as well as programming them with R. 
To repeat and practice what I learned in this course I decided to replicate the models with Python, using scikit-learn, pandas, numpy and matplotlib
